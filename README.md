## Datasets Construction

### Positive Samples
The positive dataset was constructed using **CPPsite 2.0**, a manually curated database of cell-penetrating peptides. CPPsite 2.0 provides comprehensive information on cell-penetrating peptides, including their sequences, structures, and biological activities.

### Unclassified Dataset 
#### BIOPEP-UWMix
The unclassified dataset was sourced from **BIOPEP-UWMix**, a database of human bioactive peptides. BIOPEP-UWMix contains a diverse collection of peptides with various bioactivities, providing a rich resource for bioactive peptide research.
#### SPENCER_Peptide_info 
SPENCER is a catalog of small peptides encoded by ncRNAs. The ncRNA encoding peptides were derived from re-annotation of public mass spectrometry data from over 1,700 patient samples spanning diverse cancers.
#### PeptideAtlas
PeptideAtlas is a multi-species compendium of peptides identified in a large number of tandem mass spectrometry experiments. The PeptideAtlas database contains a wealth of information on peptides identified in various biological samples.
